# mirrored-gss

This is my final project for CPS 512. Please see the project report for more details! If you want to run the project yourself, I recommend importing and building it in IntelliJ (or another IDE) and running src/Main. It will show 6 collaborative whiteboards connected to 2 different game servers, each with a 'turtle' drawing lines on it. You can see the Time Warp synchronization algorithm in action. The network in the demo has round trip time typically between 25 and 100ms.
